Stubble
========

Work towards a Ruby stubber that retains the original functionality under the hood.

Example
=======

Add some stubble
  Stubble.add_stubble!(Time)

Tell it just to track a method
  Time.track!(:now)

We can then later assert against calls

Or we can stub it

  Time.stub!(:now, [Time.mktime(2010,12,17,10,40)])
  
After Time.now has been called once, the functionality will return to normal

Or we can call

  Time.unstub!(:now)
